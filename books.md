# Books

There are very few books worth reading, so make sure to read the most important ones first. 

I've divided the books into categories so you can more easily find what you are looking for. 

Meditations by Marcus Aurelius
The book that has had the most impact on my life. 

## Literature

Siddartha by Herman Hesse
A book with a language as clear as the buddha being described. 

## Business

Business Adventures: Twelve Classic Tales from the World of Wall Street by John Brooks


## Investing

The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham
Without a doubt one of the most important books of all times with time-proven advice on how to invest. One of Warren Buffet's favorite books.
