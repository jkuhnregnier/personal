# Investing

## Principles

### 1. Once you have invested, your money is gone. 
This means that you should not be dependent on the money to live your day to day life. Thus, you will not be forced in a situation, in which you have to sell the investment due to cash shortage.

The second, and personally more important part, is that you need to see the investment as a decision. You have decided upfront everything. What you will do if the investment grows, what if it declines or is completely lost. 

All these sorts of questions and anguishes, you have resolved before ever investing. What does this do? 

Then you don't have any emotional attachment to the money. 

### 2. Ground your emotions via data.
It's easy to get carried away by your emotions. Potential investments always seem great and it's natural to think that they will work out, exactly the way your emotions tell you in that moment.

The truth is far from it, though. Investment decisions made based on emotion tend to be bad (one of the reason why most people are not good at it). Because they are emotional investors. 

### 3. Invest money you can stand to lose. 
Investing in something shouldn't leave you poor. It's exactly the opposite. It should enrich your life. 

### Untie your ego.
Whenever we make decisions, our ego is involved. The more important the decision, the higher one feels that the ego is involved. 

If you do the work upfront, you outline the reasons for investing, try to accurately measure the risks, know how long you will invest and why, you can actually take your ego out of the equation. Because you know that you did the best you could in that moment to understand whether the investment was worth the risk and why you took it. If the investment then turns bad, it was all part of the calculated risk. 

On the other hand, if you don't do this, you will see your personal capacities attached to your investment. Thus, if the value of your investment goes down, you see that as an act of incapability on your part. Of bad judgment. But you can't really blame yourself, because it's yourself after all, thus, you will have to devalue your initial judgment of your investment, which will, in turn, lead you emotional reactions such as selling your stock when it's losing and purchasing when it's going up. 

### The more emotional distance to your investment, the better. 

### Don't adopt the gambling attitude
That is you win big once, the next time you lose it all. And then you try to win it back by betting even more agressively. 

Don't do it. You will lose, that is for certain.

### You will lose.
No matter how good you are, you will certainly lose from time to time. Rather than taking this as a sign of your personal incapability, use it to learn to grow. Learn from your mistake. Obviously, for this to work well, you have to know what thought process you went through in order to decide to invest in that investment. Which is the reason why it's **absolutely necessary to lead an investment/decision journal** to discover flaws in your way of thinking. To be able to analyze them later on. 

### Keep a track record
Note down data. Note down when you invested in certain things.
