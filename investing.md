# Investing

## Principles

### 1. Once you have invested, your money is gone. 
This means that you should not be dependent on the money to live your day to day life. Thus, you will not be forced in a situation, in which you have to sell the investment due to cash shortage.

The second, and personally more important part, is that you need to see the investment as a decision. You have decided upfront everything. What you will do if the investment grows, what if it declines or is completely lost. 

All these sorts of questions and anguishes, you have resolved before ever investing. What does this do? 

Then you don't have any emotional attachment to the money. 

### 2. Ground your emotions via data.
It's easy to get carried away by your emotions. Most of the investments you make is always great and could never be better. 

Which is also the reason why most people suck at investing. Because they are emotional investors. 

### 3. Invest money you can stand to lose. 
Investing in something shouldn't leave you poor. It's exactly the opposite. It should enrich your life. 

### The more emotional distance to your investment, the better. 

### Don't adopt the gambling attitude
That is you win big once, the next time you lose it all. And then you try to win it back by betting even more agressively. 

Don't do it. You will lose, that is for certain.
