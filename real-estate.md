# Real Estate 

## Things to Consider or Look Out For:
- Building
    + When was the building built? (Hugely important).
    + With what material was the house/apartment built? Wood, stone, etc.?
- Ownership
    + When did the owners purchase the property?
    + What are their reasons for selling the property?
- Roof in good shape
    + Is it the original roof or was it exchanged some time ago?
    + When is the next revision required?
    + Important to know: How old is it? 
    + Important to know: When were the last revisions? What was done?
- Water heater
    + Should obviously work
    + When was it installed? 
    + Was the yearly maintenance work done? If so, do they have any invoices?
- Electricity
    + Any proof that they are in good shape?
    + When were they done or revised?
    + Are there enough switches in each room? And if so, are they well placed?
    + What did the installation? (It's important that it was a professional electrician, as they guarantee for the work in case of issues)
- Shower and toilettes working
    + Does the drainage work properly?
    + Does warm water and cold water work properly?
- Insulation/Heat Properties
    + What sort of insulation was used? How thick?
- 
- Canalisation
    + Is there a plan?
